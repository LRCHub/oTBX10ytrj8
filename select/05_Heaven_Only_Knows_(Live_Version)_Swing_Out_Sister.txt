It can drive you to distraction
Fill each and every minute of the day
It can bring you satisfaction
Hurt you more than words could ever say
But life's greatest discovery
Still remains a mystery

Why the gift you've been given
Makes life worth living
Heaven only knows
Could it last any longer
Could it come any stronger
Heaven only knows

Suddenly your heart discovers
That your lonely days are left behind
Soon your tears have turned to laughter
Only one thing takes up all your time
When you've found love that's made to last
You don't even have to ask

Why the gift you've been given
Makes life worth living
Heaven only knows
Could it last any longer
Could it come any stronger
Heaven only knows
If you tried to disguise it
Could your heart hide it
Heaven only knows
Never know where it comes from
But wherever love goes
Heaven only knows

When you've found love that's made to last
You don't even have to ask
Why the gift you've been given
Makes life worth living
Heaven only knows
Could it last any longer
Could it come any stronger
Heaven only knows
If you tried to disguise it
Could your heart hide it
Heaven only knows
Never know where it comes from
But wherever love goes
Heaven only knows
